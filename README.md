# Early-Drift-Detection-MLaaS
We propose a novel early drift detection framework to identify performance degradation in Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems deployed in dynamic Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The framework introduces a Drift-Detect-Act (DDA) mechanism, which leverages anomaly- based detection to capture significant shifts in data signatures
